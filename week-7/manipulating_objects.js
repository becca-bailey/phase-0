// Manipulating JavaScript Objects

// I worked on this challenge by myself.

// There is a section below where you will write your code.

// DO NOT ALTER THIS OBJECT BY ADDING ANYTHING WITHIN THE CURLY BRACES!
var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown"
}
// __________________________________________
// Write your code below.

var adam = {
  name: "Adam",
  spouse: terah,
}

terah.spouse = adam;
terah.weight = 125;
delete terah.eyeColor;
terah.children = new Object();
terah.children.carson = new Object();
terah.children.carson.name = "Carson";
terah.children.carter = new Object();
terah.children.carter.name = "Carter";
terah.children.colton = new Object();
terah.children.colton.name = "Colton";
adam.children = terah.children;

What tests did you have trouble passing? What did you do to make it pass? Why did that work?

Though I had a couple problems in the beginning caused by typos, the only test I had trouble passing was 
adam.children === terah.children.  In order to get that test to pass, I had to use dot notation rather than 
literal notation (though there may be a way to do it in a literal constructor, as well).

How difficult was it to add and delete properties outside of the object itself?

It was easy to use dot location to assign and delete properties to an object from the outside.

What did you learn about manipulating objects in this challenge?

I learned more about modifying objects with both a literal and dot constructor, and which one works best in 
different situations.  I also nested an object inside an object using the new Object() constructor.
