# 1.6 Your Website 1 Reflections

**Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository**

My github pages repository is located at http://beccanelson.github.io.

HOWEVER, since I already have a site there and would prefer not to overwrite it, I have created a gh-pages branch for the purpose of this activitiy, which is located at http://beccanelson.github.io/phase-0.

**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**

1.  Create a new repository using the + next to your profile image in the top-right corner.

2.  Name your repository [your github username].github.io.  Give your repository a README and a license (select MIT License).

3.  Click on the repository you just created, and copy the clone link on the right hand side.

4.  In your terminal, use cd to navigate to the location where you want to store the repo on your computer.  Type "git clone [copied link]" to clone the repository to your local drive.

**Describe what open source means.**

If code is open source, the code is visible to the public, and it is free for others to view, use, and build-on.

**What do you think about Open Source?  Does it make you nervous or protective?  Does it feel like utopia?**

A little of both.  I know that code does not have to be open source, so if I am working on code I would prefer not to distribute to hte public, I am free to copyright it and make the files private.  I do love that so much code is open source, though, because it means that as a developer, you can build on the work of other developers without having to re-invent everything yourself.  For all the projects I've worked on thus far, I have no problem with others using my code or making it better.

**Assess the importance of using licenses.**

By licensing your work, you are essentially saying that you hold the copyright to your work, and you are free to distribute it in the way specified in the license.  An open source license (such as GNU or MIT) says that others can use, modify, and distribute your code, usually with conditions like including the license or crediting the copyright holder.

**What concepts were solidified in the challenge?  Did you have any "aha" moments?  What did you struggle with?**

Github pages is a review for me, though I didn't know anything before about licenses.  It did take me some time to grasp the concept of open source vs. public domain, and I'm glad I spend some additional time researching this.

**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic?  If so, please list it.**
