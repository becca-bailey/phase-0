# Drawer Debugger

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# I spent 1 hours on this challenge.

# Original Code

class Drawer

  attr_reader :contents

# Are there any more methods needed in this class?

  def initialize

  end

  end

  def add_item(item)
    @contents << item
  end

  def remove_item(item = @contents.pop) #what is `#pop` doing?
    @contents.delete(item)
  end

  def dump  # what should this method return?
    puts "Your drawer is empty."
    @contents = [];
  end

  def view_contents
    puts "The drawer contains:"
    @contents.each {|silverware| puts "- " + silverware.type }
  end
end


class Silverware
  attr_reader :type, :clean

# Are there any more methods needed in this class?

  def initialize(type, clean = true)
    @type = type
    @clean = clean

# DO NOT MODIFY THE DRIVER CODE UNLESS DIRECTED TO DO SO

# Reflection

=begin

What concepts did you review in this challenge?

This challenge reviewed ruby classes, objects, and methods.  

What is still confusing to you about Ruby?

I understood mostly everyhing about this specific challenge, but I'm still confused sometimes by 
classes when they get more complex.  

What are you going to study to get more prepared for Phase 1?

Practical applications of classes and objects.
