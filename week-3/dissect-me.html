				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>Welcome to HTML Anatomy 101. In this class, you will do the learn how to dissect an HTML page from the &lt;head&gt; to the &lt;footer&gt;, add a new feature to Sublime Text, and mark up your previous blog posts with semantic HTML tags. So get your gloves on, open your textbook (the HTML docs (Links to an external site.)) and begin!</p>

				<h2>Release 0: Set up</h2>
				<p>Before you can get started, you'll need to get setup for the challenge. Decide who is going to drive and who will navigate. Then each of you will need to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Create a feature branch in the phase-0 directory</li>
					<li>Using the command line, navigate to the week-3 directory</li>
					<li>Within that directory, (using the command line) create a blank HTML page called dissect-me.html. </li>
					<li>Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub. Create a quick pull request and merge the changes. </li>
					<li>SUBMIT your link to the dissect-me.html file as soon as you do this. This is how your guide will give you feedback. The URL should be something like: <a href="#">https://github.com/[USERNAME]/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html</a> (Links to an external site.)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>NOTE: You should decide whether to trade roles in each release or change roles half way through the session. If you decide to switch from release to release, you'll want to share code easily using a collaborative editor (or even a simple google doc).</p>

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

	I don't know if there are any tags in this exercise that I haven't used often.  I mostly used common tags such as article and section to complete this exercise.  There were some HTML5 tags I didn't use for this example, like header, footer, and main.

How do elements get laid out on a page?  What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

	Elements on the page are loaded and displayed from top to bottom.  In pure HTML, elements are all in one column with no styling other than the default browser styling for each element.  Though the process of loading html is fairly straightforward, it is best practice to put script and other non-essential items at the bottom to load after the basic styles have loaded.

What did you learn about Sublimein this challenge?  Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?  What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

	Though I had used snippets before, I had never created one myself, and I am sure this is a feature I will use again.  I have been learning as much as I can over the past couple of weeks about Sublime shortcuts and plug-ins, and my favorites so far are Emmet, which is a library of shortcuts for HTML and CSS, and Nettuts+ Fetch which can be used to import external files such as HTML5 boilerplate, a reset css file, or even a framework like Wordpress.
