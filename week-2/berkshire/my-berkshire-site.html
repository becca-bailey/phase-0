<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site? - It was a lot of copying and pasting and typing. So a lot of work, but not the kind that takes too much brain power. It was a lot to keep track of too, making sure every tag is closed, and so on.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements? - It was very easy to do, with a simple google search. And in HTML5, the elements make a lot of sense, such as headers and footers.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML) - We think we did well. What helped was thinking ahead of what we will be adding in CSS to avoid formatting in the HTML.

- What seems good and bad about HTML? - It's very easy to learn, because everything follows the same basic structure of tag and end-tag. Once you learn the basic structure, there isn't that much else to add. This is also a bad thing, since you can't make an attractive page with just HTML. You must combine it with CSS or Javascript to format it.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML? - It's mostly been memorization and repetition. It also helps to add the correct spacing and indentation, in order to be able to see it well, and make sure we're doing it correctly.
