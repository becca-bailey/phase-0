**What is a wireframe?**

A wireframe is a simple diagram of the site layout, which shows where different types of content will appear on the page.  It typically uses shape outlines to define areas for images, content, navigation, text input areas, and any other basic page elements.

**What are the benefits of wireframing?**

Wireframing helps you to iterate your design process.  It is a logical step to take before creating a realistic mockup or writing the HTML and CSS, as it gives you a template to work with rather than starting from scratch.  Also, if you are working for a company or a client, it allows them to approve your design during every step of the process rather than running the risk of coding the whole site and then having to go back and revise the layout.

**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**

For the most part, yes!  I have never done this before, so once I got over the fear that I wasn't doing it right, I enjoyed it more.  I found it difficult just to decide on a way to do this.  There are so many tools and resources that it can be hard to choose.  I eventually decided on a way to design the wireframe, and next time around I will probably try something else.

**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**

I mostly stuck with my first idea, but I realize that I will probably make some edits to my original design when I write the HTML and CSS, which will necessitate editing the wireframe.

**What questions did you ask during this challenge?  What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

I wanted to know whether a wireframe has to be pixel perfect to the final design (ideally), or whether it's supposed to be a general outline. http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/34358/pixel-precision-of-wireframes

I also found a great video that helped me understand the process of wireframing with the user experience in mind.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovj4hFxko7c

**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**

I enjoy the design aspect of wireframing, but I don't enjoy the process of making exact measurements and counting pixels and trying to align elements.  There are tools that can help you accomplish this, however, which I hope to learn more about.
